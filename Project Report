Project Title: Simple Calculator with Operation History
Submitted by: Shawon Miazi
Language: C
Project Type: Console Application

🔍 Objective:
To develop a basic calculator that performs addition and subtraction operations and stores the calculation history with timestamps in a file for future reference.

⚙️ Project Description:
This project is a menu-driven calculator application that allows users to:

Perform addition and subtraction of two integers

View previously performed operations (history)

Exit the application

All operations along with date and time are stored in a text file named db.txt.

🧩 Key Features:
Addition & Subtraction functionality

File handling to save and retrieve operation history

Time logging using ctime() to store timestamps

Interactive menu for ease of use

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Language: C

Functions Used: fopen(), fprintf(), fgets(), time(), ctime()

File Used: db.txt

📂 File Structure:
db.txt: Stores logs in the format:
A + B = C >>>> Timestamp
A - B = C >>>> Timestamp

👨‍💻 Sample Output:
markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Exit
4. History
Enter choice: 1
Enter value of A: 15
Enter value of B: 5
*
15 + 5 = 20

✅ Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates basic C programming concepts including control structures, file handling, and time manipulation. It’s a simple yet effective demonstration of how C can be used to create practical console applications.
