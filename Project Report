 1. Project Overview
This project is a simple Student Record Management System developed in the C programming language. It allows the user to store, view, and manage student data efficiently using file handling and structures.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Objective
The main goal is to provide a basic system to:

Add and store student records.

Display student information.

Sort records based on semester or CGPA.

Maintain persistent storage using files.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Features
Add new student (Name, ID, CGPA, Semester).

Read and write data to a file (db.txt).

Sort student records.

View all saved data.

Simple command-line interface.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Tools and Language
Programming Language: C

Text File: Used to store records persistently

Compiler: GCC or any standard C compiler

ðŸ”¹ 5. Working Principle
When the program starts, it reads existing records from db.txt.

Users are given menu options to add, view, or sort records.

Data is saved back into the file to ensure persistence.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Challenges Faced
Handling string inputs and file operations.

Ensuring data is not overwritten.

Validating correct CGPA and semester values.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Conclusion
The project helped in understanding:

File I/O operations in C.

Use of arrays of structures.

Real-world application of basic data management.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Future Improvements
Add update/delete features.

Improve UI with colors or GUI.

Password protection for admin access.
